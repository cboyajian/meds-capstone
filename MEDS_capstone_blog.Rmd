Hello! We are [Halina](https://hdolinh.github.io/) and [Clarissa](https://cboyajian.github.io/), two current students at the University of California, Santa Barbara in the Bren School's [Masters of Environmental Data Science (MEDS)](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) inaugural cohort.

## About us

Halina has a BA in Environmental Studies & Biology from UC Santa Cruz and has experience in field research, outdoor education, environmental advocacy, and waste. While working in Los Angeles, she recognized data inaccuracies in representation and in metrics. Halina is excited to apply her data science training to address these gaps and to find equitable solutions for environmental issues affecting urban watersheds.

## MEDS Capstone Project 101

The [MEDS capstone project](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science/meds-capstone-projects) is a collaborative team experience where students use data to design, develop, and share a deliverable to help a client address an environmental issue. For the 2021-2022 academic year, all clients for capstone projects are UCSB affiliated, but in future years anyone will be able to propose a project! Projects that are chosen by the Capstone Committee get a team of 3-4 students from January to June 2022 (roughly 1 full-time staff for 6-months). All projects need to be product-oriented, have access to necessary data, be fully funded, have an environmental justice aspect, and have a clearly defined scope. Check out more in the timeline below!

## Our proposal

We are co-authors on the proposal, *Ensuring equitable access to outdoor recreation: Evaluating spatiotemporal patterns and trends in campground use on federal public lands.* If chosen, it will combine data from the [Recreation Information Database (RIDB)](https://ridb.recreation.gov/landing) and [U.S. Census Data](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) to create a tool that visually represents our analysis of access to federal lands. There is a growing need to understand and mitigate inequities in access to outdoor recreation, especially since outdoor recreation provides critical health and well-being benefits to communities. *We understand this sentiment as the two of us have experience working directly with communities and the outdoors. We care deeply about studying how people interacat with the environment.* Our primary deliverable is to create an interactive platform using the [R Package, Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). The app will summarize and visualize park-specific patterns and trends in visitation volume, demand, and visitors' location of origin.

Major shout out to [Kaitlyn Gaynor](http://www.kaitlyngaynor.com/wil) and [Will Rice](https://www.willrice.us/) for all their support and guidance on our proposal!

## Tips, thoughts, and recommondations

Now that our proposal has been submitted, we're waiting to see if it will be selected. While we wait, we've taken some time to reflect on the proposal process. There's a lot we've learned and we've compiled our most essential thoughts below.

#### Why you should write a proposal (even if you think you shouldn't or can't)

We won't deny that writing a proposal can be a daunting task -- it takes time and work! -- but we are grateful to have gone through the process. Even if you're reading this and the proposal deadline is two weeks away, we encourage you to still consider writing a proposal! See if these reasons can convince you:

-   You will hear this plenty at Bren (if you haven't already), but **networking** is a crucial part of your graduate school experience. This includes networking with your cohort! Your cohort will be some of your strongest connections after you graduate, and working on a capstone proposal with one or some of them is a great opportunity to build that connection. Beyond your cohort, working on a proposal with a client gives you several excellent opportunities to network, build your professional communication, and gain real-world experience in project development and management.

-   The MEDS program is a professional-degree program and is all about preparing you for a career for solving environmental problems using data science. The capstone proposal is one of the first opportunities you can take to prepare you for a career as a data scientist! It's an opportunity to practice several professional skills like project management, communication, research, proposal writing and data exploration! This means this is **a real-life experience that you can put on your resume.** We found this to be crucial for us since our background has few data experiences and we want to be able to graduate with both a formal degree *and* experience.

-   Our primary motivation for writing our capstone proposal was because we care about the topic. We deeply care about environmental justice, Learn more about a topic you're interested in depth

#### 5 Most Helpful Resource

1.  Each other! After the first few weeks of summer, you and your cohort will have already spent up to 40 hrs a week with each other. Meaning - there's a good chance you'll have at least a basic understanding of everyone's interests (also you may not have an interest yet, or maybe your interests are vague ideas - that's okay!). When our capstone project idea was announced during the summer as a potential project, we gravitated toward each other

#### 5 things to consider when writing about EJ

1.  **Power**

-   Who has the power in the situation?
-   Who has privilege?
-   How does power and privilege play into communication, representation, access to resources, or decision-making?

2.  **Distribution of Harm**

-   Who is receiving the brunt of the suffering or harm in the situation?

3.  **Exclusionary Solutions**

-   Does what is offered make sense for all potential parties involved?
-   Is the solution reasonable and accessible?

4.  **Racism & Xenophobia**

-   How is this factoring into the situation?
-   Does someone have less power or privilege because of their race or ethnicity?

5.  **Burden of Evidence**

-   Who is responsible for showing there is environmental harm?
-   Is this appropriate? What would an alternative be?

6.  **Ways of Knowing**

-   Whose "way of knowing" are privileged?
-   Is there a type of evidence or data that is privileged over others?
-   Is the world view of the dominant group causing harm?

7.  **Anthropocentrism / Species-ism**

-   What aspects of the environment are being systematically overlooked and why?
-   How is excessive self-centeredness playing into this - on the part of the huamns?
-   What can we do to overcome it?
