Hello! We are [Halina](https://hdolinh.github.io/) and [Clarissa](https://cboyajian.github.io/), two current students at the University of California, Santa Barbara in the Bren School's [Masters of Environmental Data Science (MEDS)](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) inaugural cohort.

## About us

Halina has a BA in Environmental Studies & Biology from UC Santa Cruz and has experience in field research, outdoor education, environmental advocacy, and waste. While working in Los Angeles, she recognized data inaccuracies in representation and in metrics. Halina is excited to apply her data science training to address these gaps and to find equitable solutions for environmental issues affecting urban watersheds.

Clarissa holds a BA in Urban and Environmental Policy from Occidental College in Los Angeles, CA. She has experience with urban forestry volunteer management and education, grant writing, and nonprofit management. In her 5+ years in the Los Angeles urban forestry sphere, she experienced a lack of data collection and analysis to guide program and policy decisions. She is excited bring her data science training collaborative work the creates equitable connections between people and the developed and wild environments.

## MEDS Capstone Project 101

The [MEDS capstone project](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science/meds-capstone-projects) is a collaborative team experience where students use data to design, develop, and share a deliverable to help a client address an environmental issue. For the 2021-2022 academic year, all clients for capstone projects are UCSB affiliated, but in future years anyone will be able to propose a project! Projects that are chosen by the Capstone Committee get a team of 3-4 students from January to June 2022 (roughly 1 full-time staff for 6-months). All projects need to be product-oriented, have access to necessary data, be fully funded, have an environmental justice aspect, and have a clearly defined scope. Check out more in the timeline below!

## Our proposal

We are co-authors on the proposal, *Ensuring equitable access to outdoor recreation: Evaluating spatiotemporal patterns and trends in campground use on federal public lands.* If chosen, it will combine data from the [Recreation Information Database (RIDB)](https://ridb.recreation.gov/landing) and [U.S. Census Data](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) to create a tool that visually represents our analysis of access to federal lands. There is a growing need to understand and mitigate inequities in access to outdoor recreation, especially since outdoor recreation provides critical health and well-being benefits to communities. *We understand this sentiment as the two of us have experience working directly with communities and the outdoors. We care deeply about studying how people interacat with the environment.* Our primary deliverable is to create an interactive platform using the [R Package, Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). The app will summarize and visualize park-specific patterns and trends in visitation volume, demand, and visitors' location of origin.

Major shout out to [Kaitlyn Gaynor](http://www.kaitlyngaynor.com/wil) and [Will Rice](https://www.willrice.us/) for all their support and guidance on our proposal!

## Tips, thoughts, and recommondations

Now that our proposal has been submitted, we're waiting to see if it will be selected. While we wait, we've taken some time to reflect on the proposal process. There's a lot we've learned and we've compiled our most essential thoughts below.

#### Why you should write a proposal (even if you think you shouldn't or can't)

We won't deny that writing a proposal can be a daunting task -- it takes time and work! -- but we think it's a worthwhile process. Even if the proposal deadline is two weeks away while you're reading this, we encourage you to write a proposal! See if these reasons can convince you:

-   You will hear this plenty at Bren (if you haven't already), but **networking** is a crucial part of your graduate school experience. This includes networking with your cohort! Your cohort will be some of your strongest connections after you graduate, and working on a capstone proposal with one or some of them is a great opportunity to build those connections. Beyond your cohort, working on a proposal with a client gives you several excellent opportunities to network with potential employers.

-   The MEDS program is a professional-degree program and is all about preparing you for a career to solve environmental problems using data science. The capstone proposal is one of the first opportunities that prepares you for a career as a data scientist! It's a moment to practice several professional skills like project management, communication, research, proposal writing and data exploration! This means this is **a real-life experience that you can put on your resume.** We found this to be crucial for us since our background has few data experiences and we want to be able to graduate with both a degree *and* relevant experience.

-   Our primary motivation to write a capstone proposal was because **we care about the topic**. We deeply care about environmental justice, and while we aren't 100% sure what this looks like for a data science career, we know we want careers that involve people and how they interact with the environment. So when we saw a proposal focused on studying spatiotemporal patterns of visitors in National Parks we both instantly wanted to know more. Writing a proposal gave us the **opportunity to dive into a topic we were interested in**. This made writing the proposal less of a daunting task since we were internally motivated. It also meant that we were more willing to challenge ourselves because we personally care about the outcome of the proposal.

#### Most Helpful Resources

- Each other! After the first few weeks of summer, you and your cohort will have already spent at least 40 hrs a week with each other. Meaning - there's a good chance you'll have at least a basic understanding of everyone's interests (also you may not have an interest yet, or maybe your interests are only vague ideas - that's okay!). Anyway, what we are trying to say is find who in your cohort has similar interests to you! Because writing a proposal together demystifies how daunting the whole task is. This allows you to split up the work, lean on each other for support, and discuss when you feel uncertain.

- We approached our client the second week of the summer and started brainstorming ideas soon after. By starting early, this gave us time to really sit with the information, the data, and the overall question we wanted to answer. When it comes to writing a proposal, **time to sit and reflect about your proposal idea is part of the process!**

- Something else you've probably heard is **don't reinvent the wheel**. Many functions and solutions you need already exist thanks to the many amazing and talented individuals within the data science field. The same goes for project proposals. If you're getting writer's block look at the [Master's Project Directory on the Bren website](https://bren.ucsb.edu/projects) to see previous years proposals for inspiration (Bren students have been doing capstone projects since 1999!). 

- Use Zotero! Talk to a librarian! Did you know each department at UCSB has their own dedicated librarian? 

- If you haven't written in awhile...talk to professors or students in the [Communications Focus](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-science-and-management/academics-mesm/communication-focus)! They know how important writing skills are and want you to succeed. Some helpful readings to check out are:  


#### The "hardest" parts of the process

Writing a proposal is doable and we're *all* capable of writing one! Describing the work before weâ€™ve learned how to do it


#### Client Inspiration (WORKING ON DATA VIZ FOR THIS WILL ADD LATER)

Don't know where to start or what client you want to work with? Check out these organizations! Here are all the clients and faculty advisors Bren students have worked with.

#### How to consider an Environmental Justice lens in your prosposal (and beyond!)

Environmental Justice (EJ) and [intersectional environmentalism](https://www.intersectionalenvironmentalist.com/) focus   

1.  **Power**

-   Who has the power in the situation?
-   Who has privilege?
-   How does power and privilege play into communication, representation, access to resources, or decision-making?

2.  **Distribution of Harm**

-   Who is receiving the brunt of the suffering or harm in the situation?

3.  **Exclusionary Solutions**

-   Does what is offered make sense for all potential parties involved?
-   Is the solution reasonable and accessible?

4.  **Racism & Xenophobia**

-   How is this factoring into the situation?
-   Does someone have less power or privilege because of their race or ethnicity?

5.  **Burden of Evidence**

-   Who is responsible for showing there is environmental harm?
-   Is this appropriate? What would an alternative be?

6.  **Ways of Knowing**

-   Whose "way of knowing" are privileged?
-   Is there a type of evidence or data that is privileged over others?
-   Is the world view of the dominant group causing harm?

7.  **Anthropocentrism / Species-ism**

-   What aspects of the environment are being systematically overlooked and why?
-   How is excessive self-centeredness playing into this - on the part of the huamns?
-   What can we do to overcome it?
