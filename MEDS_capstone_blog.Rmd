Hello! We are [Halina](https://hdolinh.github.io/) and [Clarissa](https://cboyajian.github.io/), two current students at the University of California, Santa Barbara in the Bren School's [Masters of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) inaugural cohort](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science).

## About us

Halina has a BA in Environmental Studies & Biology from UC Santa Cruz and has experience in field research, outdoor education, environmental advocacy, and waste. While working in Los Angeles, she recognized data inaccuracies in representation and in metrics. Halina is excited to apply her data science training to address these gaps and to find equitable solutions for environmental issues affecting urban watersheds. 

plans to apply her training in data science to find equitable solutions for environmental problems in urban watersheds.

## Capstone projects

The MEDS thesis equivalent is a real-world, client-focus capstone project using data to solve an environmental problem. This year, all clients for capstone projects are UCSB affiliated, but in future years anyone will be able to propose a project! Projects that are chosen by the Capstone Committee get a team of 3-4 students from January to June 2022 (roughly 1 full-time staff for 6-months). All projects need to be product-oriented, have access to necessary data, be fully funded, have an environmental justice aspect, and have a clearly defined scope with a collaborative, flexible spirit.

## Our proposal

The proposal that we worked on is called *Ensuring equitable access to outdoor recreation: Evaluating spatiotemporal patterns and trends in campground use on federal public lands.* If chosen, it will combine Recreation.gov data and U.S. Census Data to create a tool that visually represents our analysis of access to federal lands. There is a growing need to understand and mitigate inequities in access to outdoor recreation, especially on public lands. Specifically, our project will address this need by creating an interactive platform for summarizing and visualizing park-specific patterns and trends in visitation volume, demand, and visitors' location of origin.

Major shout out to Kaitlyn Gaynor and Will Rice for all their support and guidance on our proposal!

#### 5 things to consider when writing about EJ

1.  **Power**

-   Who has the power in the situation?
-   Who has privilege?
-   How does power and privilege play into communication, representation, access to resources, or decision-making?

2.  **Distribution of Harm**

-   Who is receiving the brunt of the suffering or harm in the situation?

3.  **Exclusionary Solutions**

-   Does what is offered make sense for all potential parties involved?
-   Is the solution reasonable and accessible?

4.  **Racism & Xenophobia**

-   How is this factoring into the situation?
-   Does someone have less power or privilege because of their race or ethnicity?

5.  **Burden of Evidence**

-   Who is responsible for showing there is environmental harm?
-   Is this appropriate? What would an alternative be?

6.  **Ways of Knowing**

-   Whose "way of knowing" are privileged?
-   Is there a type of evidence or data that is privileged over others?
-   Is the world view of the dominant group causing harm?

7.  **Anthropocentrism / Species-ism**

-   What aspects of the environment are being systematically overlooked and why?
-   How is excessive self-centeredness playing into this - on the part of the huamns?
-   What can we do to overcome it?
